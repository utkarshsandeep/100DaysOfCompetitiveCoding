/*
Mary has an  piece of paper that she wants to cut into  pieces according to the following rules:

She can only cut one piece of paper at a time, meaning she cannot fold the paper or layer already-cut pieces on top of one another.
Each cut is a straight line from one side of the paper to the other side of the paper. For example, the diagram below depicts the three possible ways to cut a  piece of paper:

Given  and , find and print the minimum number of cuts Mary must make to cut the paper into  squares that are  unit in size.

Input Format

A single line of two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  and .

Constraints

Output Format

Print a long integer denoting the minimum number of cuts needed to cut the entire paper into  squares.

Sample Input

3 1
Sample Output

2
Explanation

Mary first cuts the  piece of paper into a  piece and a  piece. She then cuts the  piece into two pieces:

Because it took her two cuts to get  pieces of size , we print  as our answer.
